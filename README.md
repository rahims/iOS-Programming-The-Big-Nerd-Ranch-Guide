Slowly making my way through [iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide](https://www.bignerdranch.com/book/ios_programming_the_big_nerd_ranch_guide) (4th Edition) in my spare time. This repo holds my solutions to the various challenges presented at the end of most chapters in the book. I'm learning iOS development as I go through the book, so none of this should be considered examples of "good" code/style, but it might be helpful for others that get stuck along the way.
